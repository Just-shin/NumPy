    "    Contiguous Memory Allocation:- NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, which reduces the overhead associated with memory allocation and access. This leads to more efficient use of memory compared to Python lists, which store elements as separate objects with additional metadata.\n",
    "    Homogeneous Data Types:- All elements in a NumPy array are of the same data type, which allows for more compact storage and faster access. In contrast, Python lists can store elements of different types, leading to increased memory usage.\n",
